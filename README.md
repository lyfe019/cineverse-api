CineVerse API
A Graph-Powered Movie and Person Data API
Welcome to the CineVerse API! This project provides a robust backend for managing movie, person (actors, directors), genre, and studio data, leveraging the power of a Neo4j graph database. It's designed to demonstrate efficient data modeling, relationship management, and advanced graph queries for insights and recommendations.

ðŸŒŸ Features
Movie Management: Add, retrieve, and list movies with details like title, release year, and tagline.

Person Management: Add, retrieve, and list people (actors, directors) with their birth year.

Rich Relationships:

Connect actors to movies with specific roles (ACTED_IN).

Connect directors to movies (DIRECTED).

Assign movies to genres (HAS_GENRE).

Link studios to movies they produced (PRODUCED).

Data Deletion: Delete movies, persons, or specific relationships.

Relationship Exploration: Query movies by actor/director, actors by movie, genres by movie, and studio by movie.

Graph Insights:

Find co-actors (actors who have worked together).

Discover shared movies between any two actors.

Calculate the shortest path between two actors (requires APOC plugin in Neo44j).

Advanced Recommendations:

Recommend movies based on shared genres.

Recommend movies based on shared cast and crew.

Top N Lists: Get top actors and directors by movie count.

Robust Error Handling: Custom error classes and a centralized error handling middleware provide clear and consistent API responses for various error scenarios (e.g., Not Found, Bad Request, Database Errors, Validation Failures).

Joi Validation: Request payloads are validated using Joi for data integrity and early error detection.

Pagination: List endpoints support pagination for efficient data retrieval.

ðŸŽ¬ Domain Model
The CineVerse API's strength lies in its graph-based domain model, which represents entities (nodes) and their connections (relationships) in a highly intuitive and powerful way.

Nodes:
:Movie

title (String, Unique)

released (Number, Optional)

tagline (String, Optional)

:Person

name (String, Unique)

born (Number, Optional)

:Genre

name (String, Unique)

:Studio

name (String, Unique)

Relationships:
(:Person)-[:ACTED_IN {roles: ["Role1", "Role2"]}]->(:Movie)

Connects an actor to a movie, with an array of roles as a relationship property.

(:Person)-[:DIRECTED]->(:Movie)

Connects a director to a movie.

(:Movie)-[:HAS_GENRE]->(:Genre)

Connects a movie to its genre(s).

(:Studio)-[:PRODUCED]->(:Movie)

Connects a studio to a movie it produced.

Benefits of the Graph Model:
Intuitive Representation: Directly maps real-world relationships, making the data model easy to understand and evolve.

Powerful Queries: Graph queries (Cypher) are highly efficient for traversing complex relationships, finding patterns, and performing recommendations that would be cumbersome in relational databases.

Flexibility: Easily add new types of relationships or nodes without complex schema migrations.

Performance: Optimized for connected data, leading to fast query times for relationship-heavy operations.

ðŸš€ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the CineVerse API locally.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or higher): Download & Install Node.js

npm: Comes with Node.js.

Neo4j Database (v5.x recommended):

Neo4j Desktop: Easiest way to get started. Download Neo4j Desktop

Neo4j AuraDB: Cloud-hosted Neo4j. Sign up for AuraDB Free

Docker: docker run --name neo4j -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password -e NEO4J_dbms_connector_bolt_listen__address=0.0.0.0:7687 -e NEO4J_dbms_connector_http_listen__address=0.0.0.0:7474 neo4j:latest

Setup & Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone <repository_url>
cd cineverse-api

Install dependencies:

npm install

Configuration
Create a .env file in the root of your project and add your Neo4j connection details:

# .env
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=password
APP_PORT=3000

NEO4J_URI: The connection URI for your Neo4j instance.

NEO4J_USERNAME: Your Neo4j database username.

NEO4J_PASSWORD: Your Neo4j database password.

APP_PORT: The port on which the Express API will run.

Running the API
Build the TypeScript project:

npm run build

Start the API in development mode (with nodemon for auto-restarts):

npm run dev

The API will typically run on http://localhost:3000 (or your specified APP_PORT). The console will log messages about Neo4j connection and API startup.

Note: On first run or if the database is empty, the API will automatically create unique constraints for Movie titles, Person names, Genre names, and Studio names.

ðŸ§ª Testing
While comprehensive testing setup was a later consideration, the API is designed with testability in mind.

You can run the tests using:

npm test
# To run unit tests only:
# npm run test:unit
# To run integration tests only:
# npm run test:integration

Note: Integration tests require a running Neo4j instance and will clear all data in the database specified in your .env file.

ðŸš¨ Error Handling
The API employs a centralized error handling mechanism to provide consistent and informative responses. When an error occurs, you will receive a JSON response with the following structure:

{
    "status": "error",
    "message": "A human-readable error message.",
    "details": "More specific details (e.g., validation errors, original database error message in development).",
    "errors": [ // Present for validation failures
        {
            "path": "field.subfield",
            "message": "Validation error message"
        }
    ],
    "stack": "Stack trace (only in development environment for debugging)."
}

Common HTTP Status Codes you might encounter:

200 OK: Request successful.

201 Created: Resource successfully created.

400 Bad Request: Client-side error, often due to invalid input (e.g., missing required fields, incorrect data types, unique constraint violation).

404 Not Found: The requested resource or relationship could not be found.

500 Internal Server Error: An unexpected server-side error occurred.

ðŸ’¡ Future Enhancements
Authentication & Authorization: Implement user authentication (e.g., JWT) and role-based access control.

More Advanced Graph Algorithms: Explore additional Neo4j Graph Data Science Library algorithms for deeper insights (e.g., community detection, centrality).

Caching: Implement caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data to improve performance.

GraphQL API: Provide a GraphQL interface for more flexible data querying by clients.

Docker Compose: Set up Docker Compose for easier local development with Neo4j and the API in containers.

CI/CD Pipeline: Automate testing and deployment with a CI/CD pipeline.
